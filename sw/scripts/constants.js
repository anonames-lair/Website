Continue northwards and defend the northern fort by defeating the attackers without letting Houjou Ujiteru die. At about this time Nene will infiltrate the castle, but ignore her for now. Go towards Hideyoshi's base and eventually Ieyasu and many reinforcements will show up inside the castle. Return to the castle and succeed in the mission by defeating all six Tokugawa army generals. Continue in inside the castle and you'll find that Nene has rigged the castle to explode. You'll get a mission to stop her plan. You must do so by defeating all bomb ninjas and all gunpowder kegs on the first and second floors. The placement is random each time, so search carefully. When you've gotten all of them you'll get the mission completed notice, so you'll be able to know if you've missed any. With that done climb up to the third floor and defeat Nene. Now finally save your ally general in the southwest corner, Ogawara Yasuhiro. Once you've defeated the generals around him, he'll begin retreating towards the castle doors. Escort him along the way, as he'll be sneak attacked by Sakon."
