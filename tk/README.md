# Three-Kingdoms
Tactical simulation grand strategy game based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel by Luo Guanzhong. The game uses the A* pathfinding algorithm to create paths for deployed units, and vector calculations to determine distance, direction, and other factors.

Instead of keeping save data in a database, the game provides players with a variety of tools to manage their own save data, such as: Copy Data, Download Data, and Import Data. This approach gives players more control over their save data, and allows them to easily transfer it between devices.
